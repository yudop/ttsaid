This widget application aims to help people with special needs due to visual impairment.

Initial development is focused on:

- date/time TTS speaking in fixed intervals, in response to phone events (such as screen ON/OFF events) or using a widget button.

- incoming calls - TTS speaking contact name or phone number

- incoming sms - speak contact name and message contents.
